Cacao Docker
==============

Cacao's Robot contains 2 processor unit that is Intel NUC and a Jetson Xavier NX developer kit. 
Two processors have different objectives first Jetson Xavier NX developer kit using for running the machine learning models 
and Intel NUC using for Navigation. 
Both processors do not have the same python environment, 
therefore, Cacao's team is building the docker images for executing software in the same environment as Cacao's processor

camera publishing rate is 60 hz

each node using 10% CPU and 300 MB memory

the cpu usage in following list will include realsense2 node
1 node process with 53 fps using 13% cpu
2 node process with 43 fps using 23% cpu
3 node process with 40 fps using 32% cpu
4 node process with 34 fps using 40% cpu
5 node process with 30 fps using 48% cpu
6 node process with 28 fps using 57% cpu
7 node process with 25 fps using 67% cpu
8 node process with 21 fps using 68% cpu
9 node process with 18 fps using 76% cpu
10 node process with 16 fps using 75% cpu 
11 node process with 14 fps using 82% cpu
12 node process with 13 fps using 82% cpu
13 node process with 11 fps using 83% cpu
14 node process with 10 fps using 86% cpu
15 node process with 9 fps using 86% cpu
16 node process with 9 fps using 86% cpu
17 node process with 8 fps using 90% cpu
18 node process with 7 fps using 95% cpu
19 node process with 7 fps using 100% cpu
20 node process with 7 fps using 100% cpu

after open 3 node each node using 9% cpu and still using 300 MB memory
when open 7 node each node not using constant cpu percentage its vary from 8 to 9 percentage
when open 8 node each node completely using 8% cpu and realsense camera node using 4% cpu
when open 10 node each node completely using 7% cpu and the realsense camera node using 5% cpu
when open 13 node each node completely using 6% cpu but the realsense camera node still using 5% cpu

when open 16 node each node completely using 5% cpu but the realsense camera node still using 5% cpu

when open 20 node each node not using comsntant cpu percentage its vary from 4 to 5 percentage
